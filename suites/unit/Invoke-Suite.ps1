.SYNOPSIS
    The unit suite's entry point for the orchestrator.

.DESCRIPTION
    A thin wrapper over ..\..\unit\Invoke-UnitTests.ps1: it builds the native
    GoogleTest executable (which pulls in the player's DSUtil, Subtitles and
    SubPic static libraries as project references) and runs it, translating
    the exe's JSON result into the orchestrator's pass/fail counts.

    This tier runs no player and needs no test rig, so the probe reports
    NeedsRig = $false and the orchestrator claims no guest on its behalf. It is
    also the one suite that runs on a bare bench with no emulator submodule.

    An expected failure -- a test that documents a bug present in the code
    under test today -- is not a suite failure: it is reported in Notes and
    counted as skipped, the way the dvb suite reports an assertion it cannot
    apply. An unexpected pass (a bug marker that should be removed) is a
    failure, because the exe returns non-zero for it.
